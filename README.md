# Universal Expression Project

This project represents abstract concepts and their relationships using a symbolic expression framework in Python. The project builds relationships between elements like energy, knowledge, understanding, and transformation, using operators to convey synergy, categorization, and growth, creating a "universal expression language."

## Features

- **Symbolic Representation**: Model complex relationships between abstract elements.
- **Custom Operators**: Use intuitive operators (e.g., `+`, `>`, `:`) to represent relationships.
- **Executable File**: Run the program as a standalone executable without requiring Python.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyInstaller** (for building the executable)

## Installation and Setup

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
3. Activate the virtual environment:
